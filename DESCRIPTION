Description: This package runs a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem. 
   It creates a vector of three doors and assigns "car" to one and "goat"
   to the other two. The a door is then randomly selected. Of the 
   remaing two doors, a goat is revealed. The user can then choose to 
   stay with the original door, or switch and select the remaining un-
   opened door. The results, win or lose, are then given. This package
   is set up to run the scenario n number of times and display a table 
   of proportions intidating win vs lose associated with the choice to 
   switch vs. stay.
